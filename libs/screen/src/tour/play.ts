// Walk somebody through something — a list of steps, handed to the page they

// A step is one sentence and, at most, one thing to do. Say it BEFORE the doing:
// the sentence is read, the control it names is lit up, and the step is over
// when it is pressed — by them, or by `Show me` on their behalf. `guided: true`
// starts in the mode where the tour walks itself: each step is read, a bar fills
// across the foot of the panel, and it moves on by itself when the bar is full.
// `I'll click myself` stops it where it stands and hands it back.
//
// **`open` is the exception, and it travels on the way IN.** A step's sentence
// is about the screen it names, so a step that opens another page opens it
// first and speaks there; the button on the step before says where pressing it
// goes. Otherwise the sentence for a page nobody has reached yet is read over
// the page they are still on — "the appointment queue, Omar has sent his form"
// with a patient's own portal on the screen.
//
// It used to run here, on `sleep`, driving their screen: captions faded on a
// timer, pages changed under whoever was reading, and there was nothing to press
// to stop, repeat or slow down. Steps are the same shape; only who plays them
// changed.
