// A module IS a skill directory: the project keeps its own in
// WORKDIR/.claude/skills, where the coding agent finds them as skills by itself
// and the host finds them as modules by their manifest. "./…" and "../…" resolve
// against the host's own repo, a bare relative path against the project.
//
// A path that ends in `/*` is a **folder of installed projects**: everything
// under it is mounted, each under its own folder name as a prefix, because two
// projects that both ship `patients/` must not become one namespace. That is how
// a clinical host points at the directory a manager keeps its workspaces in —
// `"path": ["../libs", "./apps/*"]`, or `PROCS_PATH=…:/srv/WORKSPACES/*` — and
// gets every app in every project without naming them one by one.

// run with `PROCS_PLUGINS` (colon-separated).
//
// `PROCS_PLUGINS=""` is the clean path: no catalogue at all, nothing read out of
// anybody's home folder. That matters everywhere that is not a laptop — a
// deploy, a test, a demo of what a fresh clone does — because otherwise the
// composition of the process depends on whose machine it runs on.
