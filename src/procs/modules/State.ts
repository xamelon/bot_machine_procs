// about itself — a name, a face, its config. **Introspection** is what it turns

// library, a `GET /<namespace>` makes it a tab, a `$hook_service.*` makes it a
// provider, a SKILL.md makes it a skill, a `$loader_*` makes it the owner of a
// kind. Nothing here is a switch to set; it is a description of what was found.
