// somebody pressed a button in this process. Everything else — a fresh clone, a
// workspace.json edited by hand, a plugin that arrived with a git pull — leaves
// the host mounting a module the agent has never heard of.

// It links every module this host has that ships a SKILL.md — the mounted ones
// and the catalogue it could mount — and takes away our own links that point at
// something the host no longer has. A real directory somebody wrote is never
// touched; neither is a symlink we did not make (readlink has to match a folder
// with a manifest).
