// origin in the load path of a clinical page.

// reasonably use the public imperative API. Publish it explicitly.

// request attribute (hx-get/hx-post/…) — an element that just wants to run
// something when it lands (wire a menu, draw a chart, mount a panel) never
// hears it. But `htmx:after:process` fires on the root of everything htmx
// processes — the body at boot, every swapped node, every oob island — so this
// hands each landed `hx-on:hyper-load` element exactly one `hyper-load` event.
// The listener itself was attached by htmx in the same processing pass, before
// this event fires.

// processes the document as soon as it is imported, so on a page where the DOM
// was parsed first that `htmx:after:process` fired with nobody listening — and
// the composer, the menus and the charts were never wired. The symptom was
// maddeningly partial: the chat looked fine, but its send button stayed disabled
// no matter what you typed, because `chat.compose` had never run to watch the
// textarea. Whether the race is lost depends on load timing, which is why it
// came and went.
//
// Every consumer guards against being wired twice (a WeakSet in chat/client.js),
// so catching up is safe even when we did hear the first pass.
//
// It has to wait for DOMContentLoaded, not just for a parsed DOM. Every client
// script is `defer`, so they run in document order — this one first, `chat`,
// `charts` and the rest after — and by then `readyState` is already
// "interactive". Booting there would fire `hyper-load` into handlers that say
// `window.chat.compose(this)` before `window.chat` exists; htmx swallows the
// TypeError and the element is silently never wired. DOMContentLoaded fires
// after the last deferred script, which is the first moment every handler this
// event reaches actually has something to call.

// The dead-man's switch for the shell. Every page the framework serves keeps
// `#main` — it is the partial contract itself. A swap that leaves the document
// without it (a boosted link that resolved to <body>, a fragment that replaced
// the shell) has destroyed the app's chrome: no tab strip, no chat, no way
// back, and every later swap lands body-wide. That state is unrecoverable from
// inside, so recover from outside: reload once onto the URL the swap pushed —
// a full document brings the shell back around the same page. Guarded so a
// reload storm is impossible.
