// What is behind a url that answers nothing — as a page, not as four bytes.
//
// A miss used to be `new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 })`, and a handler
// that knew more said it in prose: `no such patient: seed-anna`. Both replace the
// window with plain text on a white background — no rail, no tab strip, no way
// back except the browser's own — and under htmx they are worse still, because
// that text lands *inside* `#main` and the app is left with a sentence where a
// screen was.
//
// So a miss returns a value like any other page and `toResponse` dresses it: the
// host's layout on a full load, the fragment plus the chrome on a swap. `what`
// is the thing that was looked for in the words of whoever looked (`patient
// seed-anna`), because "Not Found" alone never says *what* was not found.
