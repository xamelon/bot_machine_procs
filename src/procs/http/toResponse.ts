// the navigation *between those pages*, and it cannot live in the host or every
// host would have to know it.
//
// So: a module shipping `<its name>/pane.ts` has it wrap the `main` of the routes
// under `/<its name>`, and nothing else's. The pages themselves are untouched —
// they return `{ title, main }` as before — which is the point: the navigation is
// added in one place instead of by twelve routes remembering to call a wrapper.
// It runs on the whole-document path and on the htmx fragment alike, so a swap
// into `#main` brings the module's own chrome with it.
//
// A handler that returns a `Response` of its own (the fragment a POST answers a
// section with) never comes through here, which is right: that swaps into a
// target inside the page, not over it.

//
// Read straight off the hook map rather than through `hooks.run`, because this
