// http module teardown — stop the Bun server (closing active connections), and

// `.runtime/port` is how everything on this machine finds the run — the REPL
// client, the helper the agent uses. A run that leaves its number behind sends
// the next caller to a socket nobody is listening on, and the error that comes
// back ("connection refused", or worse, another run's answer) says nothing about
// why. Only our own number is removed: a run that started after us owns the file.
